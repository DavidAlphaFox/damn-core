Skills => Actions

skill/effects =>  skill/targets

also target not needed check LoS for target/all ?  move that to target itself somehow?


also context/source | context/target -> for target-entity just pass eid into the component/do! ???

many with eid are target-entity???


calculate damage/armor modifiers into the effect, not @ damage but when sending the projectile/effect ...

no need context/source then ?

components

[k eid value1 value2 ] ??

more than [k v] ???

vimgrep/component\/do!.*entity/g src/** test/**


1. rename to effect-target/all or effect-target/entity

effect-target/range optional ? then max viewing range of entity anyway for LoS ???


effect-target/all doesn't need to check LoS to one target ? ... hmm


to hit-effects / entity-effects just pass eid [k eid v] to the effect [k v]  ???

grep effect/source => for spawn/convert pass the source entity faction into effec-ctx?

so pass whole effect-ctx? instead of merging? as value ?

[k value effect-ctx ] ??

=> small steps...

And maybe its action/source, action/target & not effect/?
