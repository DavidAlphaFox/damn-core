get-property => get-entity or just ctx/entity

=> skills/items/etc call component/create on animation/entity

also entity/image entity/animation then

no more edn->image or edn->animation serialization anymore (can delete )

later whole game ctx/components into property-editor ( !! entity-component-editor !! )



* deserialize => move to component/create
* validate => means every entity validates itself when created???
means schema for everything ?? and can even check schema at dev mode during assoc's, etc ??
or after eveery effect/do! for example on ctx???


But then we clear out all ecs ? only entities clear themself out? no need to empty ecs?

deserialize at get-property by calling component/create
=> performance problems @ audiovisual?
=> can already prepare those desrialized properties by moving into entities?

!! effect/projectile needs to be create w. component/create ...

or load them into entities but then they all get atoms??
or not ...

[:one-to-many-ids :properties/skill] -> on create fetches itself
:effect/projectile -> one-to-one fetches its data
animation/image creates itself
world?
