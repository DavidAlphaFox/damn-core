; TODO game doesnt show that its paused because of an error  (only console)

; allow default component/create which just returns value? -> how much code does it affect?
; does it break anything? I have it that way so it throws when a context/etc. forgets to add create fn
; but this is a minor issue isnt it
; also interesting components getting eid, then don;t need to pass @ fn....?
; every component/create before created add :eid ???
; so component is a record with 'eid' field? or 'parent-entity-id' ?



* item/ionventory skills also does zipmap over id
* and properties too when loading
=> they are components in a way ?
