; TODO game doesnt show that its paused because of an error  (only console)

; also interesting components getting eid, then don;t need to pass @ fn....?
; every component/create before created add :eid ???
; so component is a record with 'eid' field? or 'parent-entity-id' ?

* item/ionventory skills also does zipmap over id
* and properties too when loading
=> they are components in a way ?
