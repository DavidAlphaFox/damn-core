 ; my decoupling of stat components (hp is optional)
 ; lead me to decoupling of effects (applicable only apply (e.g. projectile no damage to princess but stuns ))
 ; lead me to sounds needing to go out of skill/effects (as wizard thought sound is useful so he cast projectile skill instead of hunting me)
 ; lead to effects having a sound / or specific transactions -> maybe effects getting defined in properties.edn too
 ; so sounds are not hardcoded (see how to do that exactly)
 ; leads to also maybe effect/target-entity is not an effect but a skill/target thingy (because if each effect needs a sound, this one is not an effect )

 ; which lead me also to meditation having to have 0 cost otherwise
 ; the wizard thinks its wise to keep refilling its mana instead of hunting me
 ; because always costs 1 mana
