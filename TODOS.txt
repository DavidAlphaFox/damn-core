; effect-ctx safe-merge into effect value !
; can let
; no merge ctx
; ?

; * sounds move into action .... grep tx/sound anyway remv
; => but what abt. target-entity? (in case of hit ground there's something already?)
; should be the 'abort' case??? and not
; & damage already has its own sound/audiovisual ?
; => each group of 'effects' has its sound ? e.g. damage grouped with 3 other things, make its own sound

; * get clear creature components/stats which required (hp for princess ... because potential field etc.)
; and flatten _


; can attack own faction w. melee ..

; (component/schema :skill/effects)
; TODO how on restarts clear out core.component/attributes & defsystems  & reload _ALL_ affecet ns's defcomponents ??

; => its part of context then ?

; al data needs also to supply default value
; e.g. DRY
; convert nil cannot set it

; Bow shouldn't have player modified stuff...

; Window doesn't icnrease size on change (add components)
; anyway full size?
; also use tree? its messy ....
; => needs to be nice...

; maxrange needs to be connected w. los - max player range / creatures
; etc.
; and optional

; TODO effect/projectile
; needs direction & source & targeT?!
; its what effect-target type usable?
; player usable in just direction, NPC's use it w. target-entity to check if possible ....

; or just keep  effect - projectile fits there
; but other ones cannot use directly -
; - entity-effect -  ?

; TODO tx.ui / tx.create / tx.entity
; or with effect
; but tx. shorter

; but doesn't work with effect/hp => stats/hp
; or always effect.entity/_stat_
; autocreate

; :entity.effect/faction
; :effect.entity/faction ?
;
; :entity-effect/damage
; :hit-effect/damage
; :tx.entity/damage
; :tx.e/damage
; ?

; * convert
; * ::stat-effect
; * melee-damage
; * damage
; * stun/kill (use all events, add even 'interrupt' or destroy' ?

; => SO ITS ABOUT definint hit-effects (also use @ projectile hit-effects)
; or entity-effects???
; there are more ... also add-skill/etc.?
; see defcomponents do! ...


; TODO effect-target/position => {:effect/spawn :creatures/skeleton-warrior}
; don't pass anymore effect/source & effect/target etc.
; =. effect-target/position or direction?? {:effect/projectile :projectiles/black}
; (more complicated ...)

; TODO probably action/sound and not sound at low lvl places ... ?

; TODO can I move other skill related stuff over here? grep key usage ???



Could even use a state machine for connecting screens
instead of checking key pressed its like events
and visualize it from the code ...


Make entities as outer-radius-circle or ellipses
but same as mouseover-entity-shown should be the collision
or show rect for now

=> but can items be placed on water??
or on walls???
-> unclarity with collides?/valid-position/z-order/etc.

* item in hand is drawn at 48x48 and in inventory cells at different size (suddenly smaller )
; but needs to be smaller because of dropping
or make dropping itself simpler

* If player colliding with a cell, highlight the cell for a second in red/orange
