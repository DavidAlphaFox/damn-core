Could even use a state machine for connecting screens
instead of checking key pressed its like events
and visualize it from the code ...


Make entities as outer-radius-circle or ellipses
but same as mouseover-entity-shown should be the collision
or show rect for now

=> but can items be placed on water??
or on walls???
-> unclarity with collides?/valid-position/z-order/etc.

* item in hand is drawn at 48x48 and in inventory cells at different size (suddenly smaller )
; but needs to be smaller because of dropping
or make dropping itself simpler

* If player colliding with a cell, highlight the cell for a second in red/orange
